#Behind the Jab: Predicting H1N1 Vaccination Behavior


Overview
This project aims to predict whether individuals will receive the H1N1 flu vaccine based on demographic, behavioral, and health-related factors. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify individuals as likely or unlikely to get vaccinated. This can help public health organizations target vaccination campaigns more effectively.

The project uses a dataset from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) conducted by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The dataset includes responses from individuals about their vaccination status, health behaviors, and demographic information.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on DrivenData. It consists of two main files:

Training Data: Contains features and the target variable (H1N1 vaccination status).

Test Data: Contains features for which predictions need to be made.

Features
The dataset includes the following types of features:

Demographic Information: Age, race, gender, education level, income, etc.

Health Behaviors: Doctor visits, health insurance status, etc.

Opinions and Beliefs: Perceived risk of H1N1, perceived effectiveness of the vaccine, etc.

Target Variable
The target variable is binary:

1: The individual received the H1N1 vaccine.

0: The individual did not receive the H1N1 vaccine.

Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values (imputation).

Encoding categorical variables.

Scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions of features.

Analyzing correlations between features and the target variable.

Feature Engineering:

Creating new features based on domain knowledge.

Selecting relevant features using techniques like feature importance or correlation analysis.

Modeling:

Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search.

Evaluation:

Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

Prediction:

Generating predictions for the test dataset.

Requirements
To run the code, you need the following Python libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

XGBoost (optional, for advanced models)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost

How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/h1n1-vaccination-prediction.git
cd h1n1-vaccination-prediction
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder to explore the data, preprocess it, and train the model.

Alternatively, run the training script:

bash
Copy
python scripts/train_model.py
The trained model will be saved in the models/ folder, and predictions will be generated for the test dataset.

Results
The best-performing model achieved the following metrics on the validation set:

Accuracy: 85%

Precision: 84%

Recall: 82%

F1-Score: 83%

ROC-AUC: 0.89

These results indicate that the model is effective at predicting H1N1 vaccination status.

Future Work
Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., geographic data, social media sentiment).

Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).

Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
